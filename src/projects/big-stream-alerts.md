Heavily inspired by [BigTechAlerts](https://twitter.com/BigStreamAlerts),
this bot tracks the activity of prominent streamers on Twitter instead of tech figures.
The code began life as experiment to track financial and political figures.
It turns out people are more interested in e-celebrities.

At it's peak it served over 24k followers and 20 million impressions per month.
Currently on pause due to Twitter API costs.
